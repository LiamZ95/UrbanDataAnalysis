Here is the video demo of Urban Data Analysis:

If you want to use the app to receive the latest dataset, simply change the method within the AsyncTask of MainActivity 'openLocalFile' to 'sendRequest' . 
Also, the button 'More detail' in MapsActivity is currently only a place holder, it will jump to a empty MapBox mapView . 
  
The app itself may add vector-tiles in the map visualization to improve proformance.
